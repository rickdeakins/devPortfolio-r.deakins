## Future Development

Unfortunately due to time constraints I was unable to complete every step I had intended. 

Future plans for the site below:
- Reworking the About page and including additional relevant information.
- A functioning contact page
- Additional links on each portfolio piece linking to the deployed project
- Reworking the Portfolio tab using Bootstraps gallery to set up a gallery for photos
- Adding additional projets to the Portfolio tab

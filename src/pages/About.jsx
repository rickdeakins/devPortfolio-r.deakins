          the creative as well as the technnical. With a background rooted in graphic design I have the ability 
          to utilize visual design elements completementary to my experience working in a more data-driven
          environment managing reporting, databases, process design and client facing business operations. With 
          the utilization of logic and analytical thinking paired with a sound visual backdrop, the developmental
